# GendBR_Generator


This is a tool I developed to help me with the generation of GENDBR when translating Pok√©mon Games.

For those who don't know, GENDBR works like this:

If you're playing as a boy, there's a line like this: 
"Forgive us, young master..."

And if you play as a girl: 
"Forgive us, young mistress...",

These two cases are stored in the text file as:
"Forgive us, young m[VAR GENDBR(00FF,0705)]asteristress..."

It has unicode support.
Python 2.7.
